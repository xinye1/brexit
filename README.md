# Visualisation of the results of the UK EU Referendum June 2016

This project now is on my blog https://xinye1.github.io/projects/brexit-cartogram-leaflet/

## Introduction

The Referendum took place on 23rd June 2016 in the UK to decide whether the country would remain a member of the European Union (known as Remain, and the other side is Leave).

And it went wrong, Leave won.

Post referendum the Remain camp struggles to understand the result, and the general belief is that a small number of regions, albeit with significant populations, overwhelmingly voted Remain, while the rest of the country voted Leave, resulting in a insignificant margin towards the Leave camp.

This visualisation attempts to provide a view on the population / region / proportion arguments.

## Notes
* The R scripts are written inside an RStudio project, which has the working directory in the root folder, therefore all the file reference has `data/` in the front.
